The framework combines optical, thermal, and electrical models to assess the performance of PV modules on various vehicle surfaces (roof, back, sides). Utilizing MATLAB's PVLIB toolbox, the optical model integrates meteorological and driving data, dynamically updating position and orientation for enhanced accuracy. Thermal modeling employs Faiman and NOCT models to account for thermal inertia during motion, while the electrical model applies a single-diode approach to estimate solar cell power output.
